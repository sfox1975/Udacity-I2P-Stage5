# Udacity-I2P-Stage5
Analysis of Titanic passenger data - Final data analysis project for the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gain introductory exposure to programmatic data analysis concepts, by analysing the factors that determined whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or did not. The project makes heavy use of NumPy and Pandas. This project was completed as the Capstone project for Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree.
